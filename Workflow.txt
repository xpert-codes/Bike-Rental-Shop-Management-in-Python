Work flow and flowchart of Bike Rental Shop Project.
First of all, we will make a login/sign-up module for admin as well as user. If the person is admin he/she will enter details and will be allowed to enter the system, if the details are not correct he/she will be returned to login module to re-enter the details. Similar is the case with user if he/she is already registered he/she will be allowed to enter the system and perform action. If the user is not registered, he will be given option to register and then sign-in.
If the person is admin and he has successfully entered the system, he/she can perform following actions;
 Enter Inventory
 New Customer Rental
 Rental Return
 Show Inventory
 End of Day Verification
 Exit Program
If the person is user, he/she can perform following actions;
 View Inventory
 Search Inventory
 Rent Bike
 Demand Rental Request
